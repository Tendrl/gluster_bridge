          name: Meaningful name for this atom, should be something that is distinguishable and understandable for notification, debugging, storing and any other similar purposes
          description: meaningful description for this atom
          outputs:
          - A set, string or list of items that this will be providing (or could provide) to others, used to correlate and associate the thing/s this atom produces, if it produces anything at all.

          global_inputs:
          - An immutable input_name => value dictionary which specifies any initial inputs that should be automatically injected into the atoms scope before the atom execution commences (this allows for providing atom local values that do not need to be provided by other atoms/dependents).
          local_inputs:
          - A set or list of required inputs for this atomâ€™s execute method
          version: An immutable version that associates version information with this atom. It can be useful in resuming older versions of atoms. Standard major, minor versioning concepts should apply
